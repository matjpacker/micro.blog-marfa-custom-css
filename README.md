# micro.blog-css

The CSS files here are for use with the Marfa theme on [micro.blog](http://micro.blog). 

I have saved each "theme" as it's own CSS file, I have also tried to name theme and add descriptions to give you an idea on what they look like, at some stage I will add screenshots. 

To use the "theme" you'll need to copy the raw CSS and paste it into the Edit CSS box that you get after choosing the Marfa theme. 

This CSS comes with no guarantees.
